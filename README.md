My idea to create an accountability app. A combination of task manager and time tracker. 
This app allows you to sign up to create a private task list. The user will be able to commit a certain number of hours to a task. 

For example I would like to commit to 5 hours to working out for the week and 2 hours to code today.  
I can track to see how close I get to those time goals.
